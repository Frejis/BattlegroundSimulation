# BattlegroundSimulation
This is a tool written in rust to simulate a hearthstone battlegrounds battle.

To do this the following have been done using a TDD approach.

The approach has been the following:

1. Identify a simple feature from the game. 
2. Write a test for said feature.
3. Implement the code for said feature.
4. Refactor
5. Run test again.


The tests are written following the guidelines declared on rustlang.
